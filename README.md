LDAPHP classes Project
================

Three PHP classes about LDAP (OpenLDAP or ActiveDirectory) requests and useful functions (specifics passwords, simple rights system, ...)

-> "ConnectLdap.class.php" is about LDAP connection and optional parameters.

-> "Ldap.class.php" is about LDAP requests and data formatting.

-> "Authentication.class.php" is about based-LDAP authentication for PHP applications. In the future, a CAS authentification will be added.
